## Quote:
Do you see the paradox?An algorithm processes a slew of
statistics and comes up with a probability that a certain person
might be a bad hire,a risky borrower,a terrorist,or a miserable
teacher.That probability is distilled into a score,which can turn
someone's life upside down.And yet when the person fights back,
"suggestive‚Äùcountervailing evidence simply won't cut it.The case
must be ironclad.The human victims of WMDs,we'll see time
and again,are held to a far higher standard of evidence than the
algorithms themselves.

## Example:
There is a model that can find the relationship between students' interest in a subject and performance on that subject. Teachers would rely on this model to help those students who have less attention on this subject because they are more likely to get poor performance. However, those students with high interest, but poor performance would not progress if the teachers rely too much on this model.

## Main research question:
Researchers want to find out that as the progress on gender balance on the society, whether or not female scientists participate more in the field of computer science by analyzing the huge amount of paper they find.

## Found:

Gender balance in the field of computer science is indeed improving. However, the progress is still very slow.
