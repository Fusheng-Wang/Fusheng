# a2: R Foundational Skills
### Preparation
1. Complete the first assignment, a1.
1. Please read: (1) Freeman and Ross(2019), Chapters 5-8; and (2) O’Neil (2016), Chapter #1, Bomb parts: What is a model? (pp. 16-31).
4. Download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).
5. Download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

## Learning suggestions
1. As you read the book chapters carefully, have RStudio open and try the examples. Seek to understand the general points of the examples in the textbook and test your understanding by creating your own bits of code.
1. You might read in a group and share bits of code with your colleagues. 
1. Once you have finished the readings, begin the assignment.
1. For each coding task, find the relevant section in the textbook. Read the section and then try to solve the coding task. 
1. If you encounter an impasse of some kind please reach out for help on Microsoft Teams: a2 channelThink of the coding tasks as puzzles. Later in the quarter you'll use what you learn to solve data science problems. 

### Notes
1. This assignment should be completed _individually_.
2. Once you have finished the two parts of this assignment be sure to push your repository back to GitHub and then submit your GitHub repo link to Canvas.

## Part I: Coding: Tasks
Open the file `assignment.R` in RStudio. Complete each of the programming tasks by typing correct R code after each task. Please see the [rubric](rubric.md) for detailed guidance on how the coding tasks will be graded.

## Part II: Critical thinking: Writing responses
Open the file ``writing_responses.md`` and complete the writing responses.
