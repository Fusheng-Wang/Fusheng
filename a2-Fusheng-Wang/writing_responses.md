# a2: Writing Responses
Please  respond to the following three  prompts.
## Think: Writing Prompt 1
According to O'Neil, data scientists build "models" of processes. In your own words (a) What is a "model;"" and (b) Why are models so important in data science? (Hint: See p. 18, last paragraph) [40 - 60 words] [4 points]

Model is the algorithm that uses the available data to predict future patterns.
Data science uses and analysis model to help people to make the best decision. Without a model, data science has no way to predict the future and help us to make the decision or find the problem.

## Think: Writing Prompt 2
At the end of Chapter 1, O'Neil gives three elements of models that can make them dangerous. Name and briefly describe each element. [3 points]

> (1) **\<Opacity>**. \<Because of the unknown purpose of the data collection, the object may induce with biased or not-precise data.>  
(2)  **\<Scale>**. \<The increasing scale will cause the loss for preciseness.>   
(3)  **\<Damage>**. \<WMD would cause great damage to people's lives and turn their life upside down. >

## Reflect and Write
For this assignment, you've read a lot of technical material, and you've solved a bunch of coding puzzles. Please reflect on **how you are learning how to learn to code**. What is hard? What is easy?  What is working? How might you improve your learning? Please consider these and similar questions and write. [about 50 words] [3 points]

Reading the book is not the most efficient way to learn code. Practice is an essential way to learn. After training, I understand how to make that knowledge I learned from the book applicable. To know how to learn code, I have to see code from a machine angle. To learn how the machine understands human language is the most efficient way to learn code.
